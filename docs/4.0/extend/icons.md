Bootstrap Material Design is designed to work with the [Google Material icons](https://material.io/icons/)
library, despite not including it by default.  
In our [Introduction docs]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/{{ site.docs_version }}/getting-started/introduction)
all our starter templates include by default this icon set.

The code to include in your `<head>` tag is:

```html
<!-- Material Design for Bootstrap fonts and icons -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700|Material+Icons">
```

Additionally, we have a handful of recommendations for you to choose from. While most icon sets include multiple file formats, we prefer SVG implementations for their improved accessibility and vector support.

## Preferred
We've tested and used these icon sets ourselves.

- [Iconic](https://useiconic.com/open/)
- [Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/)
- [Entypo](http://www.entypo.com/)

## More options
While we haven't tried these out, they do look promising and provide multiple formatsâ€”including SVG.
